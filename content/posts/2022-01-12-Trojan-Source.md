# Trojan Source

The original [Trojan Source paper](https://trojansource.codes/) encompasses a
family of attacks that rely on Unicode properties to make code *look* different
from how a compiler *processes* it. For instance the following code taken from
the paper:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main() {
  bool isAdmin = false;
  /*‚ÄÆ } ‚Å¶if (isAdmin)‚Å© ‚Å¶begin admins only */
  printf("You are an admin.\n");
  /* end admins only ‚ÄÆ { ‚Å¶*/
  return 0;
}
```

looks like there is a guard on `isAdmin` while the compiler actually reads the
following byte stream

```
/* <U+0x202E> } <U+0x2066> if (isAdmin) <U+0x2069> <U+0x2066> begin admins only */
```

This issue got submitted before the official release to the LLVM Security group,
and while we agreed this was more of a display issue than an actual
compiler-related issue, we also agreed having a `clang-tidy` check for each
flaws described in the paper could not hurt.

# Using clang-tidy

The tool named `clang-tidy` can run a bunch of extra passes on a codebase,
detecting coding convention issues, API misuses, security flaws etc. We have
been adding three new checkers:

## Detecting misleading bidirectional characters

The new check `misc-misleading-bidirectional` parses each comment and string
literal from the codebase and looks for unterminated bidirectional sequence,
i.e. sequence that leak past the end of comment or string literal, making
regular code being displayed right-to-left instead of the usual left-to-right.
In the case of the example above we get a warning close to:

```
5:3: warning: comment contains misleading bidirectional Unicode characters [misc-misleading-bidirectional]
```

## Detecting misleading identifiers

C++ allows for some Unicode codepoints within identifiers, including identifiers
that have a strong right-to-left direction, which can lead to misleading
statements. For instance in the following,

```c++
int ◊ê = ◊í;
```

Are we assigining to ``◊ê`` or to ``◊í``? We are actually doing the latter, and
that is confusing. The pass `misc-misleading-identifier` detect that
configuration and outputs a warning similar to

```
10:3: warning: identifier has right-to-left codepoints [misc-misleading-identifier]
```

## Detecting confusing identifiers

Who never received a spam using unicode characters that look alike ascii
characters to bypass some hypothetical anti-spam scanning? C like language do
not escape the trend, and it is perfeclty valid and confusing to define

```c++
int foo;
```

at some point of the program, and

```c++
int ùêüoo;
```

elsewhere. The `misc-homoglyph` checker detects such confusable identifiers
(a.k.a. *homoglyph*) based on a list of
[confusables.txt](https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest/confusables.txt)
maintained by the Unicode consortium. In the case above, one would get a warning
similar to

```
7:5: warning: ùêüoo is confusable with foo [misc-homoglyph]
```

# Concluding Words

As described in this post, we chose to implement Trojan Source counter-measure
as several `clang-tidy` checkers. Doing so instead of implementing them as Clang warning
is a trade-off on parse time.
