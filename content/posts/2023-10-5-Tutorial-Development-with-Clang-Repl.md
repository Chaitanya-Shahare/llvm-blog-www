## Introduction
I'm Krishna Narayanan, a final undergraduate at Veermata Jijabai Technological 
Institute, Mumbai and I am talking about my GSoC project in this blog post
which mentions the goals, tasks we have accomplished during this summer tenure.
My GSoC project aims to develop tutorials demonstrating the current capabilities of
Clang-repl. The need for Clang-repl is that it presents opportunities for rigorous
open-source development. However, even though it is inspired by cling, not all of
Clang-repl and Cling are the same, i.e., they are similar, but work needs to be done to
add Xeus protocol support for Clang-repl.
In a similar convention, tutorials were demonstrated for CppInterOp (clang-based C++),
Xeus-cpp (interactive programming environment for C++) and Xeus-clang-repl.

## Contributions:

This is the list of contributions according to the pull requests I have sent:

### 1. Update Clang-Repl Documentation

- https://reviews.llvm.org/D152109
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D156858
- https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/65650

This patch adds support for Clang-Repl documentation, basically, it provides all
details regarding the usage of Clang-Repl. It emphasises the features of Clang-Repl
that it offers to the user. The REPL nature enables users to prototype,
experiment and gives a user-friendly experience. Similarly, the second patch
adds Clang-Repl Execution Handling Results by Saqib in which we enabled the 
graphviz extension for the llvm/clang documents to support the graphviz convention
for pictorial representation (under review).

### 2. Add C++ InterOp Documentation Setup

- https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/87
- https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/99
- https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/105
- https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/121
- https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/pull/134

**CppInterOp** is a clang-based C++ Interoperability library, which enables interoperability
with C++ code to more interactive languages like Python. The above patch adds
documentation setup for CppInterOp consisting of both sphinx and doxygen 
documentations. The above patches have covered all topics, points catering to the
development and usage of CppInterOp which include building from source(installation)
, usage, FAQs, developerâ€™s documentation, tutorials and references. The tutorials in
the docs give a detailed understanding of C++ InterOp usage, which includes C-C++
interoperability and C++-python interoperability. 

### 3. Add xeus-clang-repl Documentation Setup

- https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-clang-repl/pull/33
- https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-clang-repl/pull/34
- https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-clang-repl/pull/35

**Xeus-clang-repl** integrates clang-repl with the xeus protocol and is a platform 
for C++ usage in Jupyter Notebooks. The above patch adds a documentation setup 
for xeus-clang-repl consisting of both sphinx and doxygen documentations. The 
documentation covers all information regarding installation, usage, importance
and references for xeus-clang-repl. It includes tutorials portraying the different
features that can be used in xeus-clang-repl, especially the C++-python integration
executing simultaneously in the Jupyter cell with the help of magic commands( %%python).

### 4. Add xeus-cpp Documentation Setup

- https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-cpp/pull/13

**Xeus-cpp** is an interactive programming environment that allows you to 
execute C++ code in a Jupyter Notebook. The above patch adds a documentation setup
for xeus-cpp consisting of both sphinx and doxygen documentations.The documentation
covers all information regarding installation, usage, importance and references
for xeus-cpp.
It includes tutorials portraying the different features that can be used in xeus-cpp,
especially the C++-python integration executing simultaneously in the Jupyter cell
with the help of magic commands(%%python).

### 5. Others

- https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-cpp/pull/12
- https://github.com/vgvassilev/clad/pull/610

These are miscellaneous patches contributing to the development of current
documentation setup and content. It includes migration from the v1 to the v2 configuration
for readthedocs setup.

## Acknowledgements

All the goals that were originally proposed have been completed to the best of my
abilities (the xeus-cpp setup has not been merged yet). I will be working on improving
these things after suggestions in the upcoming weeks to make tutorials and documentation
more understandable for users. I will keep working with the compiler research group
even after the GSoC period, contributing to tutorials and landing other development
patches.

I am extremely grateful to my mentors, Vassil and David, for their constant
help and support in the last two months. Many thanks to Vassil for providing help
and reviewing the code promptly and guiding me towards the final goal, special
thanks to Parth and Baidyanath for guiding me during the initial phase of GSoC.
The journey has been quite full of learning, experiencing new techstack and realising
the importance of documentation and tutorials for a better user experience. I thank
Vassil and all LLVM community members for giving me this great opportunity to work
with such an evergreen and interesting community.

Finally, thanking everyone at the compiler research group for assisting throughout
the GSoC period with many new concepts and help I needed. I am also thankful to
Google for providing me the opportunity to work on this project during the summer,
which helped me learn a lot and will also surely help in my career in the future.
