About a thousand people contribute code to LLVM each year. There are probably
many thousands who work on the LLVM code base in downstream projects. And even
more people use the LLVM libraries to build other cool projects on top of.
 
The many LLVM users and contributors have long been communicating with each
other using mailing lists, bugzilla, and more recently,
[Discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/latest) and [github
issues](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues). Next to these
asynchronous communication channels, the LLVM community has also long had more
synchronous communication channels, such as
[IRC](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#irc) and
[Discord](https://discord.gg/xS7Z362). Twice per year, there is the opportunity
to communicate synchronously face-to-face with other LLVM-ers from around the
world: at the [LLVM developer meetings](https://llvm.org/devmtg/). The [LLVM
socials](https://www.meetup.com/pro/llvm/) that happen in various places around
the world also provide the opportunity to meet face-to-face with LLVMers in
your area.
 
In recent years, we've added a number of online "face-to-face" synchronous
communication channels. They often are the best way to make progress quickly.
I think many don't know of their existence yet, or just need a little
encouragement to make more use of them. Therefore, I thought it was worthwhile
to highlight them in this post:

* [Online sync-ups](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#online-sync-ups)
  are regular calls on specific topics. A few of them have been running for
  years, but most started only in the last 2 years. A full list of current
  online sync-ups is documented at
  https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#online-sync-ups
* More recently, ["office
  hours"](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#office-hours) have
  started. In these, specific experienced people in the community make
  themselves available for a chat and to answer questions on anything in their
  area of expertise. They are documented at
  https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#office-hours. Whether you're
  experienced or not in LLVM, both online sync-ups and office hours can be a
  great way to get advice and help on any issues you might be facing when using
  or contributing to LLVM.
    
One last way to find LLVM events that may be interesting to you, is to look at
our [LLVM community
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=calendar@llvm.org).
It shows the schedule for most office hours, online sync-ups and socials.  If
you're an organizer of any of these events, please do not forget to [add your
event to the community calendar by inviting
calendar@llvm.org](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#llvm-community-calendar).
